# Internet-Draft Markdown Template
#
# Rename this file from draft-todo-yourname-protocol.md to get started.
# Draft name format is draft-<yourname>-<workgroup>-<name>.md
#
# Set the "title" field below at the same time.  The "abbrev" field should be
# updated too.  "abbrev" can be deleted if your title is short.
#
# You can edit the contents of the document as the same time.
# Initial setup only needs the filename and title.
# If you change title or name later, you can run the "Rewrite README" action.
#
# Do not include "-latest" in the file name.
# The tools use "draft-<name>-latest" to find the draft name *inside* the draft,
# such as the "docname" field below, and replace it with a draft number.
# The "docname" field below can be left alone: it will be updated for you.
#
# This template uses kramdown-rfc2629: https://github.com/cabo/kramdown-rfc2629
# You can replace the entire file if you prefer a different format.
# Change the file extension to match the format (.xml for XML, etc...)
#
# Delete this comment when you are done.
#
